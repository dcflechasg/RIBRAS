Base simulation ready: Version 0.1 of RIBRAS simulation in Multi-Threading
mode. Simulation compiles and runs.

The aim is to update the simulation (unsolenoide) to Multi-Thread mode
of RIBRAS line, USP, written by J.C. Zamora (master thesis ~2013?).

SiliconMonitor classes were updated to Monitor classes. These classes
are used to register information about entry particles.

The simulation includes:
- Physics List -> Imported from examples/extended/Hadrontherapy
- Basic geometry -> one solenoid
- Primary particle -> ParticleGun and GPS
- Electromagnetic field -> following the base simulation
- One Sensitive Detector -> SDMonitor which uses MonitorHit -> Entry particles
- EventAction -> It so not do anything XD
- Output -> Root
            - Defined at RunAction
	    - Filled at Run
- Macros

- Original classes BeamTestEventAction and Analysis were migrated and
  rewritten at RunAction and Run.

NOTE: The original PhysicsList (Zamora's simulation) was imported from
old Hadrontherapy example and it does not work in this moment. I
imported the new physics list from the actualized example.

DO IT:
- Include user-defined PhysicsList
-Included:
    - EventAction
    - Analysis
    - RunAction
    - Run
    - SDMonitor
    - MonitorHit
    - Macros


TO DO:

- Include other sensitive detectors
- Preliminary test of the simulation
- Define Solenoid as independent object (Construct_Solenoid)
- Define Electromagnetic field for more than one solenoid
- Final test of the simulation
- Feedback
