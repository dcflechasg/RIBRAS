Base simulation: Version 0 of RIBRAS simulation in Multi-Threading
mode. Simulation compiles and runs.

The aim is to update the simulation (unsolenoide) to Multi-Thread mode
of RIBRAS line, USP, writen by J.C. Zamora (master thesis ~2013?).

The simulation includes:
- Basic geometry -> one solenoid
- Primary particle -> ParticleGun and GPS
- Electromagnetic field -> following the base simulation
- One Sensitive Detector -> SDSiliconMonitor which uses SiliconHit
- EventAction -> It so not do anything XD
- Output -> Root
            - Defined at RunAction
	    - Filled at Run
- Macros

- Original classes BeamTestEventAction and Analysis were migrated and
  rewritten at RunAction and Run.

DO IT:
-Indluded:
    - EventAction
    - Analysis
    - RunAction
    - Run
    - SDSilicoMonitor
    - SiliconMonitorHit
    - Macros
    
TO DO:
- Indlude user-defined PhysicsList
- Include other sensitive detectors
- Preliminar test of the simulation
- Define Solenoid as idependent object (Construc_Solenoid)
- Define Electromagnetic field for more than one soleniod
- Final test of the simulation
- Feedback
